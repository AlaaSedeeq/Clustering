<h1 align="center">Clustering</h1><br>
Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups (Clusters) such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. In simple words, the aim is to segregate groups with similar traits and assign them into clusters.

<h3>Clustering Approaches :</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Hierarchical Clustering:
        <ul>
            <li>Agglomerative Clustering (Bottom-Up)
            <li>Divisive Clustering (Up-Bottom)
        </ul>
    <li>Model-Based Clustering:
        <ul>
            <li> EM
            <li> GMM
        </ul>
    <li>Partial Competitive Clustering:
        <ul>
            <li> K-Means
            <li> K-Means++
            <li> Batch K-Means
            <li> K-Medoids "Partitioning around medoids(PAM)"
            <li> Neural Gas
            <li> Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)
        </ul>
    <li>Density-Based Clustering:
        <ul>
            <li> DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering Of Applications With Noise)
        </ul>
    <li>Graph-Based Clustering:
        <ul>
            <li> POBOC (Pole-Based Overlapping Clustering)
        </ul>
</ul>
